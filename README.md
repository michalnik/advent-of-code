# Advent Of Code: Solutions

It is just my attempt to store my solutions to some of tasks of a public project Advent Of Code.

Solutions are simply in `src` folder and modules are called like
```python
# for example
advent_year = 2024
advent_day = 1

module_name = f"{advent_year}-day-{advent_day}"
```
