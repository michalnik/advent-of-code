# Advent Of Code: Solutions

It is just my attempt to store my solutions to some of tasks of a public project Advent Of Code.

Solutions are simply in `src` folder and modules are called like
```python
# for example
advent_year = 2024
advent_day = 1

module_name = f"{advent_year}-day-{advent_day}"
```

Starting with the solution for `Day 8`, I began using Jupyter for more organized development and testing.
From now on, the individual solutions can be found in the `notebook` directory,
following the same naming pattern. The only difference is the file extension, which is now `.ipynb`.

Enjoy!
